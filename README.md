# Blok Tech project by Joppe Koops
This is a project I am working on for [blok tech](https://github.com/cmda-bt) at [CMD Amsterdam](https://github.com/CMDA). 
The concept is a website where filmmakers and location managers can find recording locations. For the project we have to work on one specific feature. I'm working on a method to post locations to the website. If you want to read about the process and how my feature works you can read the [wiki](https://github.com/jkhvacmd209/blok-tech/wiki).
